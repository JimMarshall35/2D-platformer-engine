to do:
- fix resizing of layers in editor (layers contents should be preserved if there is a resize)
- optimize rendering of tile based backgrounds (not efficient at the moment)
- wrap some renderer functions in lua so that lua script based tools can draw on the editor overlay like the hard coded tools do
- add some shader based effects - NOTE - one added - make better
- Add edit undo / redo functionality to editor (command pattern)
- make abstraction interface for user input
